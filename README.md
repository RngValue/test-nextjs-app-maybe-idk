This is a [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [typescript](https://media.tenor.com/A5MU1oSl95EAAAAM/furry-boy-kisser.gif) and a lil' bit of [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) ([tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/))

## How to run on your machine :3

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project does NOT use [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to load Inter, a custom Google Font, as it kept breaking the css. "font-family: system-ui" ftw...
